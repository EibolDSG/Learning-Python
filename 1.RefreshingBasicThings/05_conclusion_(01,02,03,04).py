My conslclusion about what we saw is that:

A LIST: Can store data whith an specified structure and you can modify this
        structure

A TUPLE: Is a limited list, once you have created it, you can't modify it

A SET: Is a list but where the values are randomly ordered, the index changes,
       DOESN'T ADMIT REPEATED VALUES

A DICT: Is used to store data values in key-value pairs
